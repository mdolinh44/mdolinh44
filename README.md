### Hi, I'm Max ðŸ‘‹

I am currently a student at Denison University double majoring in Data Analytics and Economics. I particularly enjoy the cleaning, model-building, and storytelling aspects of data analytics. 

I am also the Sports Editor of Denison's student-led news publication, *The Denisonian*, a tutor for the Academic Resource Center, and a member of Denison's Studium Scholar-Leader Program. I'm very passionate about my campus involvement as it allows me to dabble in some of my other interests like journalism, while also giving me the opportunity to help other students on a daily basis. 

Outside of school, I love to play the piano and watch my favorite sports teams play.
